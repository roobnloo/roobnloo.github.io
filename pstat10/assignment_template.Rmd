```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This is a sample template for your homework and worksheet submissions.
Knit this .Rmd document to a pdf and submit the pdf on Gradescope.

## Problem 1
Clearly label which problem you are solving.
If your solution involves code, include a code chunk:
```{r}
hello <- "Hello World!"
toupper(hello) # toupper function capitalizes all characters.
```
In the above, I added a comment for unclear code.
As discussed in class, make sure your lines of code do not exceed 80 characters.

## Problem 2
Sometimes problems have subproblems. You should clearly indicate which subproblem
you are answering:

1. Here is my solution to part 1
2. Here is a solution to part 2:
```{r}
sorted <- sort(1:10, decreasing = T)
sorted
```
3. Part 3 of the problem.
