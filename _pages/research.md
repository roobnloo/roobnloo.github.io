I am broadly interested in statistical learning with high-dimensional data.
I am particularly interested in developing convex optimization methods for LASSO-type problems where $$p \gg n$$.

I also like to think about issues with reproducibility, statistical power, and causal inference in the social sciences and enjoy reproducing results from old sociology papers on the side.

Please reach out to me if you would like to collaborate on large, raw data sets.
