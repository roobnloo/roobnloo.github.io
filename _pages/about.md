I am a third year PhD student at UC Santa Barbara in the department of [Statistics and Applied Probability](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.

Before joining UCSB in Fall 2020, I worked as a software developer in financial services
where I encountered optimization problems for econometric data.
Before that, I got my Bachelor's degrees from the University of Michigan where I double-majored in computer science and honors mathematics ([295-396 series](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/undergraduate-math-courses/200-level-math-courses.html)).

My legal name is spelled with a "u" as in "Ruobin", but it is still pronounced "Robin".

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
