## Welcome to PSTAT 10

I will post all course material on this page including slides, worksheets, homework, 
worksheet and homework solutions.

Worksheets and homework are released at the beginning of the week and are due the following Tuesday evening.
Worksheet solutions are released the day *before* they are due.
Assignments should be submitted on Gradescope.

### **Install R and RStudio**
R version at least 4.1.0 is required for this class. I insist you install R 4.2.0.
If you cannot install R or RStudio for whatever reason, RStudio Cloud is available.

[Install R from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)\
[Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\
[RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)

### **Recommended resources**
#### Community
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)\
[R stats community on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats)\
[Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) (particularly recommend the `dplyr`, RMarkdown, and RStudio IDE cheatsheets)

#### Books (optional)
[Davies - The Book of R](https://nostarch.com/bookofr) (the "official" course text)\
[Matloff - The Art of R Programming](https://nostarch.com/artofr.htm) (good descriptions of base R)\
[Matloff - Probability and Statistics for Data Science](https://www.routledge.com/Probability-and-Statistics-for-Data-Science-Math--R--Data/Matloff/p/book/9781138393295) (for simulation)\
[Wickham - R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) (for `tidyverse`/data science workflow)\
[Wickham - Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) (if you want to know how R really works)

#### General coding practice
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)\
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)\
