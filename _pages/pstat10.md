### **Install R and RStudio**
R version at least 4.1.0 is required for this class. I insist you install R 4.2.0.
If you cannot install R or RStudio for whatever reason, RStudio Cloud is available.

[Install R from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)\
[Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\
[RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)

### **Recommended resources**
#### Community
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)\
[R stats community on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats)\
[Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) (particularly recommend the `dplyr`, RMarkdown, and RStudio IDE cheatsheets)

#### Books (optional)
[Davies - The Book of R](https://nostarch.com/bookofr) (the "official" course text)\
[Matloff - The Art of R Programming](https://nostarch.com/artofr.htm) (good descriptions of base R)\
[Matloff - Probability and Statistics for Data Science](https://www.routledge.com/Probability-and-Statistics-for-Data-Science-Math--R--Data/Matloff/p/book/9781138393295) (for simulation)\
[Wickham - R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) (for `tidyverse`/data science workflow)\
[Wickham - Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) (if you want to know how R really works)

#### General coding practice
